# Netflix Landing Page Clone
This project includes a web page developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a clone of Netflix's landing page.<br/>
JavaScript is used to interact with tabbed interfaces.<br/>

These JavaScript code snippets enable users to click on tab headers to highlight the selected tab and display the corresponding content. This allows users to explore and switch between different tabbed content sections.<br/>
